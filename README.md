## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (SCSS) for styling

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of CSS Grid and how to effectively manage layout responsiveness. I also improved my ability to use Sass for styling and structuring stylesheets in a modular way.

A key takeaway was how to overlay elements while maintaining readability:

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Further refine my Sass structure for better maintainability
- Improve my use of CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Explore more advanced accessibility techniques

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Helped me structure the grid layout efficiently.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Reinforced my understanding of Sass features.
